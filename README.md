# WebProject

Here there can be found some simple web projects.

## BangGoodWebClient.py requirements

To scrape some data: namely the product name and both prices, offer and regular price,
from the webpage, and print it (with the ultimate goal of using any
notification method to send the user the information).

### Considerations

It is a very simple code. 
- We use urllib in order to download the page. 
- For managing the page's xml code we use bs4
- Then we can get the data that is required
- Finally we print it.
